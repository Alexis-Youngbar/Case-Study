<h1>How it started!</h1>

    <p>For my first design challenge I was tasked with making a travel app. The start-ups goal was to launch a modern day mobile 
    app. My tasks were:
  
    <ul class="different"> <li class="different">Crafting a user research plan</li> 
  
    <li class="different">Writing an interview script</li>
  
    <li class="different">Conducting user interviews</li>
  
    <li class="different">Synthesizing user research into an affinity diagram</li>
  
    <li class="different">Developing an empathy map for potential user</li>
  
    <li class="different">Creating a user persona from an empathy map and affinity diagram</li>
  
    <li class="different">Create a low fidelity prototype and mid fidelity</li></ul>
    </p>

  <h1>Interviews</h1>

  <h4>Interview plan:</h4>
  
  <p>In this research project I conducted 5 interviews with individuals whom have 
    kids and travel as a family or travel as a family with their own parents.
  
    <h4>Intro Questions:</h4>
  
    <ul class="different"><li class="different">Could you tell me about your family (members, ages)?</li>
  
        <li class="different">What motivates you to travel?</li>
  
        <li class="different">What are some travel apps or websites you normally use?</li>
  
        <li class="different">When was the last time you traveled?</li>
  
        <li class="different">Problem Identification Questions:</li>
  
        <li class="different">How do you plan a vacation, is it a discussion or on a whim type of thing?</li>
  
        <li class="different">How much time do you spend on searching for a destination to go to?</li>
  
        <li class="different">Tell me what happened the last time you tried to plan a vacation using another app/website?</li>
  
        <li class="different">Are there any current traveling apps/websites you prefer if so why?</li>
  
        <li class="different">Are there any pain points currently when using that app/website?</li>
  
        <li class="different">What do you find the most difficult when planning a trip?</li>
  
        <li class="different">What is the maximum amount of time you want to spend on trying to figure out where to go?</li>
  
        <li class="different">What kind of features would you like to see on a traveling website/app?</li>
  
        <li class="different">Are other peoples reviews or traveling photos influential to you?</li>
  
        <li class="different">Would you think an attraction guide might be helpful for your family?</li></ul>
  
        <h4>My favorite interview transcripts:</h4>
  
        <ul class="different"><li class="different">“I would love to see military discounts, one click vacation packages at cheapest prices.”</li>
  
        <li class="different"> “Just about anything motivates me to travel, work, family, friends, and concerts”</li>
  
  <li class="different">“I would like a verified review section for a feature that way I know bots aren't writing fake reviews.”</li>
</ul>

<!--User Persona and User Journey Map-->
<section>
  
  <h1>Persona</h1>
  <p>Based on the interviews and my affinity diagram I set up one persona. I 
    referred to them throughout the entire product development process.</p>
    <img class="persona" src="images/userpersona.png">
  <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
  
  <p>Russell Hodge needs a way to to plan a family vacation quick and easily 
  because he is always busy from work and doesn’t have much time to search for 
  destinations due to his busy schedule. Busy parents need to find ways to spend 
  quality time together with the kids as a way to decompress and take a break from 
  everyday life. Going on vacations are a great example of spending quality time 
  together.</p>

  <h1>User Journey Map</h1>
  <p>I made this user journey map to understand what John was going through when opening 
  my app to understand some of his thoughts and feelings to make a better product 
  from this.</p>
  <img class="journeymap" src="images/userjourney.png">

<!--User Flow Chart-->
<section>
    <h1>User Flow Chart</h1>

    <p>I created this user flow chart to show the different pathways a user can take while using my app. 
    The flow chart begins when a user first downloads Dérive, then continues with if you already have an account you c
    an sign in. The next part was to show they can sign up with their email or social media account, or just go to the 
    sign in option, then that leads them to the homepage. From the homepage they can do 3 things, plan itinerary, click 
    on destination icon to find hotels in that destination, or click on a flight icon to book a flight. If users are 
    ready they can checkout or they can go back and add another option for example if they book a hotel and want to then 
    book a flight they are able to go back and do so. After they checkout they are able to add coupons or offers and pay 
    with their credit card or Apple pay or PayPal then confirm the checkout and then they would get a verification email.</p>

<!--Comp Analysis-->
<section>
  <div>
  <h1>Competitor Analysis</h1>
  <img  class="companalysis" src="images/competitiveanalysis.jpg">


  <p>I did a competitor analysis charts to apps and websites similar to my idea for Dérive. I 
  compared the other companies strengths and weaknesses to Dérives strengths and weaknesses.</p>

    <h1>Competitor Screenshots</h1>
    <img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshot1.jpg">
    <p>This was a quick analysis of TripAdvisor, and I left my thoughts on the sticky notes about 
      what I did or did not like.</p>

 <h1>Guerilla Remote Testing</h1> 

  <h4>Objective:</h4>
  
  <p>My objective for conducting this test is to find current pain points with my prototype.</p>
  
  <h4>Target Users:</h4>
  
      <p>My target users are working families from ages 25-50, who travel spontaneously and don’t have a lot of time to search for destinations due to being busy with work.</p>
  
      <h4>Questions I want answered:</h4>
  
        <ol class="different"><li class="different">Can users pick a destination easily and book a hotel?</li>
  
            <li class="different">Can users pick a flight easily and book a flight?</li>
  
            <li class="different">Do users think my itinerary is helpful?</li></ol>
  
  <h4>Tasks and Scenarios:</h4>
  
    <ul class="different"><li class="different">Task 1 - Book a hotel</li>

  <h1>What have I learned from this project?</h1>

  <p>This Project was an eye opening experience for me. It taught me that UX is not only just design 
  but research too! Research, Data, Analyzing, and Testing, with data or facts to back up every design 
  choice you make. I learned Users are SUPER important to creating a design because something that may 
  make sense to you such a button or icon may not make sense to the User. User Research is the foundation 
  of UX Design and supports strong design solutions. I’ve come to appreciate the work behind every app 
  and website design.</p>
